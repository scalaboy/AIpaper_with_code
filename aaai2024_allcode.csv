0,Minghao Fu; Ke Zhu; Jianxin Wu,DTL: Disentangled Transfer Learning for Visual Recognition,"When pre-trained models become rapidly larger, the cost of fine-tuning on
downstream tasks steadily increases, too. To economically fine-tune these
models, parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed, which only
tunes a tiny subset of trainable parameters to efficiently learn quality
representations. However, current PETL methods are facing the dilemma that
during training the GPU memory footprint is not effectively reduced as
trainable parameters. PETL will likely fail, too, if the full fine-tuning
encounters the out-of-GPU-memory issue. This phenomenon happens because
trainable parameters from these methods are generally entangled with the
backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored in GPU
memory for gradient propagation. To alleviate this problem, we introduce
Disentangled Transfer Learning (DTL), which disentangles the trainable
parameters from the backbone using a lightweight Compact Side Network (CSN). By
progressively extracting task-specific information with a few low-rank linear
mappings and appropriately adding the information back to the backbone, CSN
effectively realizes knowledge transfer in various downstream tasks. We
conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method.
The proposed method not only reduces a large amount of GPU memory usage and
trainable parameters, but also outperforms existing PETL methods by a
significant margin in accuracy, achieving new state-of-the-art on several
standard benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/heekhero/DTL."

has emerged as a de facto standard for improving the performance of small
neural networks. However, prevailing KD-based approaches in video tasks
primarily focus on designing loss functions and fusing cross-modal information.
This overlooks the spatial-temporal feature semantics, resulting in limited
advancements in model compression. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces an
innovative knowledge distillation framework, with the generative model for
training a lightweight student model. In particular, the framework is organized
into two steps: the initial phase is Feature Representation, wherein a
generative model-based attention module is trained to represent feature
semantics; Subsequently, the Generative-based Feature Distillation phase
encompasses both Generative Distillation and Attention Distillation, with the
objective of transferring attention-based feature semantics with the generative
model. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through comprehensive
experiments on diverse popular datasets, proving considerable enhancements in
video action recognition task. Moreover, the effectiveness of our proposed
framework is validated in the context of more intricate video action detection
task. Our code is available at https://github.com/aaai-24/Generative-based-KD."

Collaborative 3D Object Detection","Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception has recently gained
significant attention due to its capability to enhance scene understanding by
integrating information from various agents, e.g., vehicles, and
infrastructure. However, current works often treat the information from each
agent equally, ignoring the inherent domain gap caused by the utilization of
different LiDAR sensors of each agent, thus leading to suboptimal performance.
In this paper, we propose DI-V2X, that aims to learn Domain-Invariant
representations through a new distillation framework to mitigate the domain
discrepancy in the context of V2X 3D object detection. DI-V2X comprises three
essential components: a domain-mixing instance augmentation (DMA) module, a
progressive domain-invariant distillation (PDD) module, and a domain-adaptive
fusion (DAF) module. Specifically, DMA builds a domain-mixing 3D instance bank
for the teacher and student models during training, resulting in aligned data
representation. Next, PDD encourages the student models from different domains
to gradually learn a domain-invariant feature representation towards the
teacher, where the overlapping regions between agents are employed as guidance
to facilitate the distillation process. Furthermore, DAF closes the domain gap
between the students by incorporating calibration-aware domain-adaptive
attention. Extensive experiments on the challenging DAIR-V2X and V2XSet
benchmark datasets demonstrate DI-V2X achieves remarkable performance,
outperforming all the previous V2X models. Code is available at

has the potential to relieve radiologists from the heavy burden of report
writing. Despite recent advancements, accurate MRG remains challenging due to
the need for precise clinical understanding and disease identification.
Moreover, the imbalanced distribution of diseases makes the challenge even more
pronounced, as rare diseases are underrepresented in training data, making
their diagnostic performance unreliable. To address these challenges, we
propose diagnosis-driven prompts for medical report generation (PromptMRG), a
novel framework that aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MRG with the
guidance of diagnosis-aware prompts. Specifically, PromptMRG is based on
encoder-decoder architecture with an extra disease classification branch. When
generating reports, the diagnostic results from the classification branch are
converted into token prompts to explicitly guide the generation process. To
further improve the diagnostic accuracy, we design cross-modal feature
enhancement, which retrieves similar reports from the database to assist the
diagnosis of a query image by leveraging the knowledge from a pre-trained CLIP.
Moreover, the disease imbalanced issue is addressed by applying an adaptive
logit-adjusted loss to the classification branch based on the individual
learning status of each disease, which overcomes the barrier of text decoder's
inability to manipulate disease distributions. Experiments on two MRG
benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed method, where it obtains
state-of-the-art clinical efficacy performance on both datasets. The code is

Augmentation","Online deep clustering refers to the joint use of a feature extraction
network and a clustering model to assign cluster labels to each new data point
or batch as it is processed. While faster and more versatile than offline
methods, online clustering can easily reach the collapsed solution where the
encoder maps all inputs to the same point and all are put into a single
cluster. Successful existing models have employed various techniques to avoid
this problem, most of which require data augmentation or which aim to make the
average soft assignment across the dataset the same for each cluster. We
propose a method that does not require data augmentation, and that, differently
from existing methods, regularizes the hard assignments. Using a Bayesian
framework, we derive an intuitive optimization objective that can be
straightforwardly included in the training of the encoder network. Tested on
four image datasets and one human-activity recognition dataset, it consistently
avoids collapse more robustly than other methods and leads to more accurate
clustering. We also conduct further experiments and analyses justifying our
choice to regularize the hard cluster assignments. Code is available at

learn the uncertainty of the underlying factors influencing their contents. In
this paper, we propose a novel video prediction model, which has
infinite-dimensional latent variables over the spatio-temporal domain.
Specifically, we first decompose the video motion and content information, then
take a neural stochastic differential equation to predict the temporal motion
information, and finally, an image diffusion model autoregressively generates
the video frame by conditioning on the predicted motion feature and the
previous frame. The better expressiveness and stronger stochasticity learning
capability of our model lead to state-of-the-art video prediction performances.

Regression","Existing techniques for text detection can be broadly classified into two
primary groups: segmentation-based and regression-based methods. Segmentation
models offer enhanced robustness to font variations but require intricate
post-processing, leading to high computational overhead. Regression-based
methods undertake instance-aware prediction but face limitations in robustness
and data efficiency due to their reliance on high-level representations. In our
academic pursuit, we propose SRFormer, a unified DETR-based model with
amalgamated Segmentation and Regression, aiming at the synergistic harnessing
of the inherent robustness in segmentation representations, along with the
straightforward post-processing of instance-level regression. Our empirical
analysis indicates that favorable segmentation predictions can be obtained at
the initial decoder layers. In light of this, we constrain the incorporation of
segmentation branches to the first few decoder layers and employ progressive
regression refinement in subsequent layers, achieving performance gains while
minimizing computational load from the mask.Furthermore, we propose a
Mask-informed Query Enhancement module. We take the segmentation result as a
natural soft-ROI to pool and extract robust pixel representations, which are
then employed to enhance and diversify instance queries. Extensive

attracted wide attention. However, previous approaches always achieve limited
performance, due to two critical factors are seriously overlooked. 1) The
contribution of image and text modalities is different, but incorrectly treated
equally. 2) There exist inherent labeling noises in describing users'
intentions with text in web datasets from diverse real-world scenarios, giving
rise to overfitting. We propose a Dynamic Weighted Combiner (DWC) to tackle the
above challenges, which includes three merits. First, we propose an Editable
Modality De-equalizer (EMD) by taking into account the contribution disparity
between modalities, containing two modality feature editors and an adaptive
weighted combiner. Second, to alleviate labeling noises and data bias, we
propose a dynamic soft-similarity label generator (SSG) to implicitly improve
noisy supervision. Finally, to bridge modality gaps and facilitate similarity
learning, we propose a CLIP-based mutual enhancement module alternately trained
by a mixed-modality contrastive loss. Extensive experiments verify that our
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world

8,Jichang Li; Guanbin Li; Hui Cheng; Zicheng Liao; Yizhou Yu,FedDiv: Collaborative Noise Filtering for Federated Learning with Noisy Labels,"Federated learning with noisy labels (F-LNL) aims at seeking an optimal
server model via collaborative distributed learning by aggregating multiple
client models trained with local noisy or clean samples. On the basis of a
federated learning framework, recent advances primarily adopt label noise
filtering to separate clean samples from noisy ones on each client, thereby
mitigating the negative impact of label noise. However, these prior methods do
not learn noise filters by exploiting knowledge across all clients, leading to
sub-optimal and inferior noise filtering performance and thus damaging training
stability. In this paper, we present FedDiv to tackle the challenges of F-LNL.
Specifically, we propose a global noise filter called Federated Noise Filter
for effectively identifying samples with noisy labels on every client, thereby
raising stability during local training sessions. Without sacrificing data
privacy, this is achieved by modeling the global distribution of label noise
across all clients. Then, in an effort to make the global model achieve higher
performance, we introduce a Predictive Consistency based Sampler to identify
more credible local data for local model training, thus preventing noise
memorization and further boosting the training stability. Extensive experiments
on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Clothing1M demonstrate that \texttt{FedDiv}

data. Due to the difficulty of annotating a large number of samples, label
noise caused by incorrect annotations is inevitable, resulting in low model
performance and poor model generalization. To combat label noise, current
methods usually select clean samples based on the small-loss criterion and use
these samples for training. Due to some noisy samples similar to clean ones,
these small-loss criterion-based methods are still affected by label noise. To
address this issue, in this work, we propose Regroup Median Loss (RML) to
reduce the probability of selecting noisy samples and correct losses of noisy
samples. RML randomly selects samples with the same label as the training
samples based on a new loss processing method. Then, we combine the stable mean
loss and the robust median loss through a proposed regrouping strategy to
obtain robust loss estimation for noisy samples. To further improve the model
performance against label noise, we propose a new sample selection strategy and
build a semi-supervised method based on RML. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, for both the traditionally trained and semi-supervised models, RML
achieves a significant improvement on synthetic and complex real-world

branch incurs undesirable computational overhead and slows inference speed. To
eliminate this dilemma, we propose SCTNet, a single branch CNN with transformer
semantic information for real-time segmentation. SCTNet enjoys the rich
semantic representations of an inference-free semantic branch while retaining
the high efficiency of lightweight single branch CNN. SCTNet utilizes a
transformer as the training-only semantic branch considering its superb ability
to extract long-range context. With the help of the proposed transformer-like
CNN block CFBlock and the semantic information alignment module, SCTNet could
capture the rich semantic information from the transformer branch in training.
During the inference, only the single branch CNN needs to be deployed. We
conduct extensive experiments on Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO-Stuff-10K, and
the results show that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

Inspired by augmentation approaches that perturb data with Gaussian noise for
populating low data density regions, we model the mask distribution with a

trustworthiness of multimedia, leading to the development of Image Manipulation
Localization (IML). But what makes a good IML model? The answer lies in the way
to capture artifacts. Exploiting artifacts requires the model to extract
non-semantic discrepancies between manipulated and authentic regions,
necessitating explicit comparisons between the two areas. With the
self-attention mechanism, naturally, the Transformer should be a better
candidate to capture artifacts. However, due to limited datasets, there is
currently no pure ViT-based approach for IML to serve as a benchmark, and CNNs
dominate the entire task. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from weak long-range and
non-semantic modeling. To bridge this gap, based on the fact that artifacts are
sensitive to image resolution, amplified under multi-scale features, and
massive at the manipulation border, we formulate the answer to the former
question as building a ViT with high-resolution capacity, multi-scale feature
extraction capability, and manipulation edge supervision that could converge
with a small amount of data. We term this simple but effective ViT paradigm
IML-ViT, which has significant potential to become a new benchmark for IML.

Compatible Attacks","Image stitching seamlessly integrates images captured from varying
perspectives into a single wide field-of-view image. Such integration not only
broadens the captured scene but also augments holistic perception in computer
vision applications. Given a pair of captured images, subtle perturbations and
distortions which go unnoticed by the human visual system tend to attack the
correspondence matching, impairing the performance of image stitching
algorithms. In light of this challenge, this paper presents the first attempt
to improve the robustness of image stitching against adversarial attacks.
Specifically, we introduce a stitching-oriented attack~(SoA), tailored to
amplify the alignment loss within overlapping regions, thereby targeting the
feature matching procedure. To establish an attack resistant model, we delve
into the robustness of stitching architecture and develop an adaptive
adversarial training~(AAT) to balance attack resistance with stitching
precision. In this way, we relieve the gap between the routine adversarial
training and benign models, ensuring resilience without quality compromise.
Comprehensive evaluation across real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
deterioration of SoA on stitching performance. Furthermore, AAT emerges as a

implicitly encodes information on past examples, enabling relational gradients
for the student. We then show that the normalisation of representations is
tightly coupled with the training dynamics of this projector, which can have a
large impact on the students performance. Finally, we show that a simple soft
maximum function can be used to address any significant capacity gap problems.
Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that using these
insights can lead to superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
knowledge distillation techniques, despite being much more computationally
efficient. In particular, we obtain these results across image classification

Estimation","Recently, self-supervised monocular depth estimation has gained popularity
with numerous applications in autonomous driving and robotics. However,
existing solutions primarily seek to estimate depth from immediate visual
features, and struggle to recover fine-grained scene details with limited
generalization. In this paper, we introduce SQLdepth, a novel approach that can
effectively learn fine-grained scene structures from motion. In SQLdepth, we
propose a novel Self Query Layer (SQL) to build a self-cost volume and infer
depth from it, rather than inferring depth from feature maps. The self-cost
volume implicitly captures the intrinsic geometry of the scene within a single
frame. Each individual slice of the volume signifies the relative distances
between points and objects within a latent space. Ultimately, this volume is
compressed to the depth map via a novel decoding approach. Experimental results

state-of-the-art performance (AbsRel = $0.082$ on KITTI, $0.052$ on KITTI with
improved ground-truth and $0.106$ on Cityscapes), achieves $9.9\%$, $5.5\%$ and
$4.5\%$ error reduction from the previous best. In addition, our approach
showcases reduced training complexity, computational efficiency, improved

Moreover, the self-supervised pre-trained and metric fine-tuned SQLdepth can

this challenge, prompt tuning has emerged as an alternative. However, existing
works still face two problems when adapting pretrained image-text models to
downstream video-text tasks: (1) The visual encoder could only encode

failed to mitigate the visual-text modality gap. To this end, we propose DGL, a
cross-modal Dynamic prompt tuning method with Global-Local video attention. In
contrast to previous prompt tuning methods, we employ the shared latent space
to generate local-level text and frame prompts that encourage inter-modal

Transformer","Video Motion Magnification (VMM) aims to break the resolution limit of human
visual perception capability and reveal the imperceptible minor motion that
contains valuable information in the macroscopic domain. However, challenges
arise in this task due to photon noise inevitably introduced by photographic
devices and spatial inconsistency in amplification, leading to flickering
artifacts in static fields and motion blur and distortion in dynamic fields in
the video. Existing methods focus on explicit motion modeling without
emphasizing prioritized denoising during the motion magnification process. This
paper proposes a novel dynamic filtering strategy to achieve static-dynamic
field adaptive denoising. Specifically, based on Eulerian theory, we separate
texture and shape to extract motion representation through inter-frame shape
differences, expecting to leverage these subdivided features to solve this task
finely. Then, we introduce a novel dynamic filter that eliminates noise cues
and preserves critical features in the motion magnification and amplification
generation phases. Overall, our unified framework, EulerMormer, is a pioneering
effort to first equip with Transformer in learning-based VMM. The core of the
dynamic filter lies in a global dynamic sparse cross-covariance attention
mechanism that explicitly removes noise while preserving vital information,
coupled with a multi-scale dual-path gating mechanism that selectively
regulates the dependence on different frequency features to reduce spatial
attenuation and complement motion boundaries. We demonstrate extensive
experiments that EulerMormer achieves more robust video motion magnification
from the Eulerian perspective, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

GroundVLP, a simple yet effective zero-shot method that harnesses visual

pure object detection data, both of which are more conveniently obtainable and
offer a broader domain compared to visual grounding annotation data. GroundVLP
proposes a fusion mechanism that combines the heatmap from GradCAM and the
object proposals of open-vocabulary detectors. We demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly outperforms other zero-shot methods on RefCOCO/+/g

Space","This work investigates efficient score-based black-box adversarial attacks
with a high Attack Success Rate (ASR) and good generalizability. We design a
novel attack method based on a Disentangled Feature space, called DifAttack,
which differs significantly from the existing ones operating over the entire
feature space. Specifically, DifAttack firstly disentangles an image's latent
feature into an adversarial feature and a visual feature, where the former
dominates the adversarial capability of an image, while the latter largely
determines its visual appearance. We train an autoencoder for the
disentanglement by using pairs of clean images and their Adversarial Examples
(AEs) generated from available surrogate models via white-box attack methods.
Eventually, DifAttack iteratively optimizes the adversarial feature according
to the query feedback from the victim model until a successful AE is generated,
while keeping the visual feature unaltered. In addition, due to the avoidance
of using surrogate models' gradient information when optimizing AEs for
black-box models, our proposed DifAttack inherently possesses better attack
capability in the open-set scenario, where the training dataset of the victim
model is unknown. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in ASR and query efficiency simultaneously,
especially in the targeted attack and open-set scenarios. The code is available

critical topic in the era of large models. This work focuses on adaptively

challenged when dealing with sparse input. Existing approaches that incorporate
additional depth or semantic supervision can alleviate this issue to an extent.
However, the process of supervision collection is not only costly but also
potentially inaccurate, leading to poor performance and generalization ability
in diverse scenarios. In our work, we introduce a novel model: the
Collaborative Neural Radiance Fields (ColNeRF) designed to work with sparse

sparse input images and the cooperation between the output of the neural
radiation field. Through this, we construct a novel collaborative module that
aligns information from various views and meanwhile imposes self-supervised

Collaborative Cross-View Volume Integration module (CCVI) is proposed to
capture complex occlusions and implicitly infer the spatial location of

program bugs, among other development issues, is commonplace in modern software
development practice. Runtime exceptions (RE) is one such important class of
bugs that is actively discussed on SO. In this work we present a technique and
prototype tool called MAESTRO that can automatically recommend an SO post that
is most relevant to a given Java RE in a developer's code. MAESTRO compares the
exception-generating program scenario in the developer's code with that
discussed in an SO post and returns the post with the closest match. To extract
and compare the exception scenario effectively, MAESTRO first uses the answer
code snippets in a post to implicate a subset of lines in the post's question
code snippet as responsible for the exception and then compares these lines
with the developer's code in terms of their respective Abstract Program Graph
(APG) representations. The APG is a simplified and abstracted derivative of an
abstract syntax tree, proposed in this work, that allows an effective
comparison of the functionality embodied in the high-level program structure,
while discarding many of the low-level syntactic or semantic differences. We
evaluate MAESTRO on a benchmark of 78 instances of Java REs extracted from the
top 500 Java projects on GitHub and show that MAESTRO can return either a
highly relevant or somewhat relevant SO post corresponding to the exception
instance in 71% of the cases, compared to relevant posts returned in only 8% -
44% instances, by four competitor tools based on state-of-the-art techniques.
We also conduct a user experience study of MAESTRO with 10 Java developers,

detection. The exceptional image reconstruction capabilities of recently
popular diffusion models have sparked research efforts to utilize them for
enhanced reconstruction of anomalous images. Nonetheless, these methods might

observed in recent high-resolution virtual try-on approach. The tendency is
empirically found that the textures of clothes are squeezed at the sleeve, as
visualized in the upper row of Fig.1(a). A main reason for the issue arises
from a gradient conflict between two popular losses, the Total Variation (TV)
and adversarial losses. Specifically, the TV loss aims to disconnect boundaries
between the sleeve and torso in a warped clothing mask, whereas the adversarial
loss aims to combine between them. Such contrary objectives feedback the
misaligned gradients to a cascaded appearance flow estimation, resulting in
undesirable squeezing artifacts. To reduce this, we propose a Sequential
Deformation (SD-VITON) that disentangles the appearance flow prediction layers
into TV objective-dominant (TVOB) layers and a task-coexistence (TACO) layer.
Specifically, we coarsely fit the clothes onto a human body via the TVOB
layers, and then keep on refining via the TACO layer. In addition, the bottom
row of Fig.1(a) shows a different type of squeezing artifacts around the waist.
To address it, we further propose that we first warp the clothes into a
tucked-out shirts style, and then partially erase the texture from the warped
clothes without hurting the smoothness of the appearance flows. Experimental
results show that our SD-VITON successfully resolves both types of artifacts
and outperforms the baseline methods. Source code will be available at

neural architecture search (NAS). However, current predictor-based approaches
overlook the fact that training a predictor necessitates a considerable number
of trained neural networks as the labeled training set, which is costly to
obtain. Therefore, the critical issue in utilizing predictors for NAS is to
train a high-performance predictor using as few trained neural networks as
possible. Although some methods attempt to address this problem through
unsupervised learning, they often result in inaccurate predictions. We argue
that the unsupervised tasks intended for the common graph data are too
challenging for neural networks, causing unsupervised training to be
susceptible to performance crashes in NAS. To address this issue, we propose a
Curricumum-guided Contrastive Learning framework for neural Predictor (DCLP).
Our method simplifies the contrastive task by designing a novel curriculum to
enhance the stability of unlabeled training data distribution during
contrastive training. Specifically, we propose a scheduler that ranks the
training data according to the contrastive difficulty of each data and then
inputs them to the contrastive learner in order. This approach concentrates the
training data distribution and makes contrastive training more efficient. By
using our method, the contrastive learner incrementally learns feature
representations via unsupervised data on a smooth learning curve, avoiding
performance crashes that may occur with excessively variable training data
distributions. We experimentally demonstrate that DCLP has high accuracy and
efficiency compared with existing predictors, and shows promising potential to
discover superior architectures in various search spaces when combined with

attempts merely introduce source statistics to mitigate this issue, the
fundamental problem of inaccurate target estimation still persists, leaving the
intrinsic test-time domain shifts unresolved. This paper delves into the
problem of mini-batch degradation. By unraveling batch normalization, we
discover that the inexact target statistics largely stem from the substantially
reduced class diversity in batch. Drawing upon this insight, we introduce a
straightforward tool, Test-time Exponential Moving Average (TEMA), to bridge
the class diversity gap between training and testing batches. Importantly, our
TEMA adaptively extends the scope of typical methods beyond the current batch

negative images apart to optimize the learned embedding. In the scenario of
long-tailed recognition, where the number of samples in each class is
imbalanced, treating two types of positive samples equally leads to the biased
optimization for intra-category distance. In addition, similarity relationship
among negative samples, that are ignored by SCL, also presents meaningful
semantic cues. To improve the performance on long-tailed recognition, this
paper addresses those two issues of SCL by decoupling the training objective.
Specifically, it decouples two types of positives in SCL and optimizes their

abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is
proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by
adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its
robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative
adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model.
However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable

the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of
robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's

RGB form equivalent to that of Digital Single-Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras, has
become an important area of research. However, current methods often ignore the
difference between cell phone RAW images and DSLR camera RGB images, a
difference that goes beyond the color matrix and extends to spatial structure
due to resolution variations. Recent methods directly rebuild color mapping and
spatial structure via shared deep representation, limiting optimal performance.
Inspired by Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, which distinguishes image
restoration and enhancement, we present a novel Neural ISP framework, named
FourierISP. This approach breaks the image down into style and structure within
the frequency domain, allowing for independent optimization. FourierISP is
comprised of three subnetworks: Phase Enhance Subnet for structural refinement,
Amplitude Refine Subnet for color learning, and Color Adaptation Subnet for
blending them in a smooth manner. This approach sharpens both color and

approach realizes state-of-the-art results. Code will be available at

Language Models (LLMs) at a relatively low cost, which have demonstrated
notable success. Existing methods assume Transformer Layer (TL) hidden states
are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). They
usually optimize the TL hidden states to memorize target knowledge and use it
to update the weights of the FFN in LLMs. However, the information flow of TL
hidden states comes from three parts: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), FFN,
and residual connections. Existing methods neglect the fact that the TL hidden
states contains information not specifically required for FFN. Consequently,
the performance of model editing decreases. To achieve more precise model
editing, we analyze hidden states of MHSA and FFN, finding that MHSA encodes
certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This implies that MHSA weights
do not require updating when new knowledge is introduced. Based on above
findings, we introduce PMET, which simultaneously optimizes Transformer

49,Qibin He,Prompting Multi-Modal Image Segmentation with Semantic Grouping,"Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) requires detection models trained using
auxiliary data to detect anomalies without any training sample in a target
dataset. It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to
various concerns, eg, data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need
to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of
foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as
defects/tumors on different products/organs, can vary significantly. Recently
large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks,
including anomaly detection. However, their ZSAD performance is weak since the
VLMs focus more on modeling the class semantics of the foreground objects
rather than the abnormality/normality in the images. In this paper we introduce
a novel approach, namely AnomalyCLIP, to adapt CLIP for accurate ZSAD across
different domains. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic
text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image
regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the
abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized
normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale
experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP
achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies

correlations from the annotation artifacts, leading to an obvious performance
decline on unbiased datasets. Among the various debiasing works, the causal
inference-based methods become popular by performing theoretically guaranteed
debiasing such as casual intervention or counterfactual reasoning. However,
existing causal inference-based debiasing methods, which mainly formulate fact
verification as a single-hop reasoning task to tackle shallow bias patterns,
cannot deal with the complicated bias patterns hidden in multiple hops of
evidence. To address the challenge, we propose Causal Walk, a novel method for
debiasing multi-hop fact verification from a causal perspective with front-door
adjustment. Specifically, in the structural causal model, the reasoning path
between the treatment (the input claim-evidence graph) and the outcome (the
veracity label) is introduced as the mediator to block the confounder. With the
front-door adjustment, the causal effect between the treatment and the outcome
is decomposed into the causal effect between the treatment and the mediator,
which is estimated by applying the idea of random walk, and the causal effect
between the mediator and the outcome, which is estimated with normalized
weighted geometric mean approximation. To investigate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, an adversarial multi-hop fact verification dataset and a
symmetric multi-hop fact verification dataset are proposed with the help of the
large language model. Experimental results show that Causal Walk outperforms
some previous debiasing methods on both existing datasets and the newly

due to the complexity of real-world scenarios. Existing approaches, whether
proposal-based or keypoint-based, suffer from depicting lanes effectively and
efficiently. Proposal-based methods detect lanes by distinguishing and
regressing a collection of proposals in a streamlined top-down way, yet lack
sufficient flexibility in lane representation. Keypoint-based methods, on the
other hand, construct lanes flexibly from local descriptors, which typically
entail complicated post-processing. In this paper, we present a
""Sketch-and-Refine"" paradigm that utilizes the merits of both keypoint-based

are semantically simple and clear. At the ""Sketch"" stage, local directions of
keypoints can be easily estimated by fast convolutional layers. Then we can
build a set of lane proposals accordingly with moderate accuracy. At the
""Refine"" stage, we further optimize these proposals via a novel Lane Segment
Association Module (LSAM), which allows adaptive lane segment adjustment. Last
but not least, we propose multi-level feature integration to enrich lane

benefits of LiDAR information could be greatly hindered by the significant
modality gap between different sensory modalities. To address this issue, we
propose a Simulated multi-modal Distillation (SimDistill) method by carefully

devise multi-modal architectures for both teacher and student models, including
a LiDAR-camera fusion-based teacher and a simulated fusion-based student. Owing

operations due to their scalability, maintenance, and flexibility. However, it
becomes challenging for site reliability engineers (SREs) to pinpoint the root
cause due to the complex relationships in microservices when facing system
malfunctions. Previous research employed structured learning methods (e.g.,
PC-algorithm) to establish causal relationships and derive root causes from
causal graphs. Nevertheless, they ignored the temporal order of time series
data and failed to leverage the rich information inherent in the temporal
relationships. For instance, in cases where there is a sudden spike in CPU
utilization, it can lead to an increase in latency for other microservices.
However, in this scenario, the anomaly in CPU utilization occurs before the
latency increase, rather than simultaneously. As a result, the PC-algorithm
fails to capture such characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose
RUN, a novel approach for root cause analysis using neural Granger causal
discovery with contrastive learning. RUN enhances the backbone encoder by
integrating contextual information from time series, and leverages a time
series forecasting model to conduct neural Granger causal discovery. In
addition, RUN incorporates Pagerank with a personalization vector to
efficiently recommend the top-k root causes. Extensive experiments conducted on
the synthetic and real-world microservice-based datasets demonstrate that RUN

instances called topics. It explicitly models an image as a multinomial
distribution of topics, and then performs probabilistic feature matching. This
approach improves the robustness of matching by focusing on the same semantic
areas between the images. In addition, the inferred topics provide
interpretability for matching the results, making our method explainable.

stark contrast to the current SOTA adversarial training methods, UEraser uses
adversarial augmentations, which extends beyond the confines of $ \ell_p $

in multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, existing methods
often perform poorly on image-text matching tasks that require structured
representations, i.e., representations of objects, attributes, and relations.
As illustrated in Fig.~reffig:case (a), the models cannot make a distinction
between ``An astronaut rides a horse"" and ``A horse rides an astronaut"". This
is because they fail to fully leverage structured knowledge when learning
representations in multi-modal scenarios. In this paper, we present an
end-to-end framework Structure-CLIP, which integrates Scene Graph Knowledge
(SGK) to enhance multi-modal structured representations. Firstly, we use scene
graphs to guide the construction of semantic negative examples, which results
in an increased emphasis on learning structured representations. Moreover, a
Knowledge-Enhance Encoder (KEE) is proposed to leverage SGK as input to further
enhance structured representations. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, we pre-train our model with the aforementioned approaches and
conduct experiments on downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
Structure-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on VG-Attribution
and VG-Relation datasets, with 12.5% and 4.1% ahead of the multi-modal SOTA
model respectively. Meanwhile, the results on MSCOCO indicate that
Structure-CLIP significantly enhances the structured representations while
maintaining the ability of general representations. Our code is available at

algorithms play an essential role in solving competitive games. Current
self-play algorithms optimize the agent to maximize expected win-rates against
its current or historical copies, making it often stuck in the local optimum
and its strategy style simple and homogeneous. A possible solution is to
improve the diversity of policies, which helps the agent break the stalemate
and enhances its robustness when facing different opponents. However, enhancing
diversity in the self-play algorithms is not trivial. In this paper, we aim to
introduce diversity from the perspective that agents could have diverse risk
preferences in the face of uncertainty. Specifically, we design a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm called Risk-sensitive Proximal Policy
Optimization (RPPO), which smoothly interpolates between worst-case and
best-case policy learning and allows for policy learning with desired risk
preferences. Seamlessly integrating RPPO with population-based self-play,
agents in the population optimize dynamic risk-sensitive objectives with
experiences from playing against diverse opponents. Empirical results show that
our method achieves comparable or superior performance in competitive games and
that diverse modes of behaviors emerge. Our code is public online at

research attention recently. However, most of these methods take a
unidirectional extraction framework that first extracts all subjects and then
extracts objects and relations simultaneously based on the subjects extracted.
This framework has an obvious deficiency that it is too sensitive to the
extraction results of subjects. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a
bidirectional extraction framework based method that extracts triples based on
the entity pairs extracted from two complementary directions. Concretely, we
first extract all possible subject-object pairs from two paralleled directions.
These two extraction directions are connected by a shared encoder component,
thus the extraction features from one direction can flow to another direction
and vice versa. By this way, the extractions of two directions can boost and
complement each other. Next, we assign all possible relations for each entity
pair by a biaffine model. During training, we observe that the share structure
will lead to a convergence rate inconsistency issue which is harmful to
performance. So we propose a share-aware learning mechanism to address it. We
evaluate the proposed model on multiple benchmark datasets. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed model is very effective and it
achieves state-of-the-art results on all of these datasets. Moreover,
experiments show that both the proposed bidirectional extraction framework and
the share-aware learning mechanism have good adaptability and can be used to

physics-informed machine learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in crowd simulation but fail to model the heterogeneity and

SPDiff takes both the interactive and historical information of crowds in the
current timeframe to reverse the diffusion process, thereby generating the
distribution of pedestrian movement in the subsequent timeframe. Inspired by
the well-known social physics model, i.e., Social Force, regarding crowd
dynamics, we design a crowd interaction module to guide the denoising process

interactions. To mitigate error accumulation in long-term simulations, we
propose a multi-frame rollout training algorithm for diffusion modeling.

graph data across diverse domains. While GNNs excel in scenarios where the
testing data shares the distribution of their training counterparts (in
distribution, ID), they often exhibit incorrect predictions when confronted
with samples from an unfamiliar distribution (out-of-distribution, OOD). To
identify and reject OOD samples with GNNs, recent studies have explored graph
OOD detection, often focusing on training a specific model or modifying the
data on top of a well-trained GNN. Despite their effectiveness, these methods
come with heavy training resources and costs, as they need to optimize the
GNN-based models on training data. Moreover, their reliance on modifying the
original GNNs and accessing training data further restricts their universality.
To this end, this paper introduces a method to detect Graph Out-of-Distribution
At Test-time (namely GOODAT), a data-centric, unsupervised, and plug-and-play
solution that operates independently of training data and modifications of GNN
architecture. With a lightweight graph masker, GOODAT can learn informative
subgraphs from test samples, enabling the capture of distinct graph patterns
between OOD and ID samples. To optimize the graph masker, we meticulously
design three unsupervised objective functions based on the graph information
bottleneck principle, motivating the masker to capture compact yet informative

emerged, notably the ones based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).
However, these methods often struggle to fulfill the requirements of flexible

Therefore, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, namely terrain diffusion
network (TDN), which actively incorporates user guidance for enhanced
controllability, taking into account terrain features like rivers, ridges,
basins, and peaks. Instead of adhering to a conventional monolithic denoising
process, which often compromises the fidelity of terrain details or the
alignment with user control, a multi-level denoising scheme is proposed to
generate more realistic terrains by taking into account fine-grained details,
particularly those related to climatic patterns influenced by erosion and
tectonic activities. Specifically, three terrain synthesisers are designed for
structural, intermediate, and fine-grained level denoising purposes, which
allow each synthesiser concentrate on a distinct terrain aspect. Moreover, to
maximise the efficiency of our TDN, we further introduce terrain and sketch
latent spaces for the synthesizers with pre-trained terrain autoencoders.
